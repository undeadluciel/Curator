  "description": "<One who rises with money, will fall with money!/In the near future, new powerful devices called relics were found. Their powers were out of this worldâ€¦ and so earth was destroyed./But even in this devastated state, there were three things that survived; cockroaches, scammers, and government officials!/The second son of an elite family, Hong You Tae, is smart and intelligent with great social skills. He's also a candidate worthy of joining the relic management department!>",
